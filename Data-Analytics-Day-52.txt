Advanced Data Analytics Lessons

🔹 Lesson 1: Feature Engineering
==================================
Summary:
Feature engineering = creating new variables that improve model performance.
Combine columns (e.g., First_Name + Last_Name → Full_Name)
Create ratios (e.g., Sales / Customers = Avg. Purchase)
Extract time-based features (e.g., Order_Date → Month, Weekday)

Example:
In e-commerce, adding a new column “Days Since Last Purchase” helps identify loyal vs inactive customers.


🔹 Lesson 2: Data Normalization & Scaling
===========================================
Summary:
Scaling ensures features contribute equally in analysis.
Min-Max Scaling → values between 0–1
Standardization (Z-score) → mean = 0, std = 1
Needed for ML algorithms like KNN, Logistic Regression

Example:
Salary column (₹20k–₹2L) vs. Age (20–60). Scaling ensures salary doesn’t dominate age in clustering.


🔹 Lesson 3: Advanced SQL – Aggregations & Group By
==================================================
Summary:
SQL aggregations summarize large datasets.
COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()
GROUP BY → summarize by category

Example:
Find total sales per region:
---------------------------
SELECT region, SUM(sales) as total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY region;


🔹 Lesson 4: Data Storytelling with Visuals
==========================================
Summary:
Analytics is not just numbers—it’s about communicating insights.
Use the right chart type (bar, line, scatter, pie, etc.)
Highlight key takeaways (insight > decoration)
Keep it simple and business-focused

Example:
Instead of showing a 10-column Excel table, display a bar chart:
“📊 North region contributes 45% of total sales” → clear, actionable.


🔹 Lesson 5: Mini Case Study – Customer Segmentation
===================================================
Summary:
Clean and normalize customer data
Use SQL GROUP BY to find high vs low-value customers
Create visual segments (e.g., bar chart of spend levels)
Recommend business strategy → “Top 20% of customers drive 70% revenue.”

Example:
Amazon clusters customers into Prime vs Non-Prime to personalize offers.
